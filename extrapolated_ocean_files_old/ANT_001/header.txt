! Icemodel-ocean header file, created on 2022- 4-25
!
! This header describes the icemodel set-up that was used to created this
! extrapolated ocean data file. Since creating these is computationally intensive,
! reading them from files is preferred. These header files make ice model
! a bit more flexible when using different input files for the four model regions.

! The original global ocean file that was extrapolated
original_ocean_filename       = '/Users/berends/Documents/Datasets/World_Ocean_Atlas/woa18_decav_ts00_04_remapcon_r360x180_NaN.nc'

! The vertical grid the ocean data was projected to
choice_ocean_vertical_grid    = 'regular'
nz_ocean                      =    11
ocean_vertical_grid_max_depth =      1500.0000

! Resolution and Gaussian smoothing radius used for the high-resolution extrapolation
ocean_extrap_res              =      5000.0000
ocean_extrap_Gauss_sigma      =      8000.0000

! Parameters of the high-resolution grid
