# IMAU-ICE

Last updated: 2021-02-16 by Tijn Berends (c.j.berends@uu.nl)

This repository contains the source code of IMAU-ICE, as well as a few scripts for compiling and running the code locally and on the UU Gemini system.

Note: the built-in benchmark experiments can be run with this. In order to run "realistic" simulations of Greenland, Antarctica, or the Laurentide / Eurasian ice sheets, you need the proper input files. Contact me if you want those.
